baseConvStudent.py - This program will convert any base <25 
to any other base <25. It does this in two steps:
basex->base10 and base10->basey

baseConvTemplate.py - This is the same program with four
key calculations taken out. These were things I thought the
students should be able to do, but this is merely a suggestion
so the original baseConvStudent.py is here as well.
