#This file contains a simple program that computes mathematical operations

#Students should predict the answers to each operation, then uncomment
#the print statements to find out the computed values.

#Next students should add parentheses to get these values:
#a)37
#b)10
#c)-18
#d)-2
#NOTE: the ** symbol is the Python version of the power sign so 2**3 = 8
a = 2 * 14 + 8 * 3 - 13 * 3

#print("The answer to a is :",a)

b = 5 % 3 + 2 ** 3 + 5

#print("The answer to b is :",b)

c = 3 - 7 * 5 + 6 / 3 

#print("The answer to c is :",c)

d = 2 ** 4 / 8 * 5 - 6

#print("The answer to d is :",d)


#Integer division (denoted as // ) is different from normal division
#Looking at these examples, predict what the difference might be.

e = 7/2
f = 7//2
#print("e and f are:",e," and :",f)

#Now use parentheses, integer, and normal division with g, h and i to get 
#A) 1
#B) 0
#C) 8.333

g = 25
h = 9
i = 3

#A =

#print("The answer to A is :",A)

#B = 

#print("The answer to B is :",B)

#C =

#print("The answer to C is :",C)
